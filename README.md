   - Load Bellflower High School calendar (pre-configured)

### For Bellflower High School Students & Teachers
Schedule Monitor comes with Bellflower High School's calendar pre-loaded, including:
- Normal, Late Start, and Minimum Day schedules
- Automatic odd/even day detection
- Special event schedules (Anchor Day, etc.)

I do my best to keep the Bellflower calendar updated with the latest schedule changes and events as they're announced. However, since schedules can change throughout the year, I recommend:
- Double-checking important dates with the [official school calendar](https://bellflowerhigh.org/)
- Using the Calendar feature to make personal adjustments when needed
- Reporting any discrepancies via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/oirehm/schedulemonitor/issues) so I can update the defaults

*Want to help keep the calendar current? Feel free to submit updates or corrections!*
